# Flashcard Versus Game - Client

A live production example is available at:

http://w4kw4c8.49.13.84.100.sslip.io/

> The above is deployed using the docker files included in both client and server repositories.

## Run the client development server

```sh
npm install
```
```sh
npm run dev
```

The above will start a Vite development server, host and port information will be available in the console.

Additionally the server code should also be run for the client to function.
